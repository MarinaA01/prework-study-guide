# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide was created with the intent of providing a resource for future students preparing for their coding bootcamp. The study guide will provide all the necessary materials to guide students in their first project. Throughout the process I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. More specifically, I learned about how to create and update a repository as well as add files in through the MacOS Terminal.
